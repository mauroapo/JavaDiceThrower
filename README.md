# JavaDiceThrower

This is a simple dice thrower I build in java.

## Installation

To installed download the DiceThrower.jar from the repository.

## Usage

After the installation open your command terminal in the folder where the jar file is located and type `java -jar DiceThrower.jar`.
It's pretty straightfoward from there.
